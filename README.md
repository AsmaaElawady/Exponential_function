# Exponential_function

The value e^x can be approximated by the sum
1 + x + x2/2! + x3/3! + ... + xn/n!
Program that takes a value x as input and outputs this sum for n taken
to be each of the values 1 to 100. The program should also output e^x
calculated using the predefined function exp. The function exp is a predefined function
such that exp(x) returns an approximation to the value e^x
